## Features

- Full support for Racket's core language features
- Clean intermediate representation for optimization
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Comprehensive documentation (API Reference + this Guide)
- Rojo project integration
- Watch mode for automatic recompilation

## Getting Started

- **[[Installation]]({{< relref "installation.md" >}}):** How to install Apollo.
- **[[Usage]]({{< relref "usage.md" >}}):** How to use the compiler (CLI and library).
- **[[Rojo Integration]]({{< relref "rojo-integration.md" >}}):** Compiling entire Roblox projects.

## Advanced Topics

- **[[Design Document]]({{< relref "design.md" >}}):** Learn about the compiler's architecture.
- **[[Project Structure]]({{< relref "structure.md" >}}):** Understand the codebase layout.
- **[[Contributing]]({{< relref "../contributing.md" >}}):** How to contribute to Apollo.
